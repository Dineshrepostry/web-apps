This is a Dynamic e-bookstore where users can buy differnt books related to computer science.

In order to use this website you will need a local apache server with MySQL(eg. XAMPP).

If you are having a local server with apache and MySQL there is still one step before proceeding.

First create a database by the name "probookstore" , then import the "probookstore.sql" file into your database.

NOTE: if the database name that you give while creating is differnet the website will not work.

Thank you.
