					<h3>ONLINE LEARNING</h3>
						<img src="resources/online.jpg" alt="online education" title="online education" class="img"/>
						<p>
				While countries are at different points in their COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school closures due to the pandemic. In Denmark, children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools after initially closing on 12 March, but in South Korea students are responding to roll calls from their teachers online.

With this sudden shift away from the classroom in many parts of the globe, some are wondering whether the adoption of online learning will continue to persist post-pandemic, and how such a shift would impact the worldwide education market.
			Even before COVID-19, there was already high growth and adoption in education technology, with global edtech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall market for online education projected to reach $350 Billion by 2025. Whether it is language apps, virtual tutoring, video conferencing tools, or online learning software, there has been a significant surge in usage since COVID-19.
			How is the education sector responding to COVID-19?

In response to significant demand, many online learning platforms are offering free access to their services, including platforms like BYJU’S, a Bangalore-based educational technology and online tutoring firm founded in 2011, which is now the world’s most highly valued edtech company. Since announcing free live classes on its Think and Learn app, BYJU’s has seen a 200% increase in the number of new students using its product, according to Mrinal Mohit, the company's Chief Operating Officer.

Tencent classroom, meanwhile, has been used extensively since mid-February after the Chinese government instructed a quarter of a billion full-time students to resume their studies through online platforms. This resulted in the largest “online movement” in the history of education with approximately 730,000, or 81% of K-12 students, attending classes via the Tencent K-12 Online School in Wuhan.

Other companies are bolstering capabilities to provide a one-stop shop for teachers and students. For example, Lark, a Singapore-based collaboration suite initially developed by ByteDance as an internal tool to meet its own exponential growth, began offering teachers and students unlimited video conferencing time, auto-translation capabilities, real-time co-editing of project work, and smart calendar scheduling, amongst other features. To do so quickly and in a time of crisis, Lark ramped up its global server infrastructure and engineering capabilities to ensure reliable connectivity.

Alibaba’s distance learning solution, DingTalk, had to prepare for a similar influx: “To support large-scale remote work, the platform tapped Alibaba Cloud to deploy more than 100,000 new cloud servers in just two hours last month – setting a new record for rapid capacity expansion,” according to DingTalk CEO, Chen Hang.

Some school districts are forming unique partnerships, like the one between The Los Angeles Unified School District and PBS SoCal/KCET to offer local educational broadcasts, with separate channels focused on different ages, and a range of digital options. Media organizations such as the BBC are also powering virtual learning; Bitesize Daily, launched on 20 April, is offering 14 weeks of curriculum-based learning for kids across the UK with celebrities like Manchester City footballer Sergio Aguero teaching some of the content.

					<h3> Digital Employees</h3>
						<img src="resources/Bus.jpg" alt="robots in surgeries" title="robot" class="img"/>
						<p>
							Digital assistants are various types of software that are capable of performing rule-based work processes and communicating with people through writing and speech. The digital assistants are represented by technologies such as the Robotics Process Automation (RPA), chatbots and voice assistants. These assistants are new digital colleagues that will help the organisations of the future meet the demands for productivity and accessibility, as well as supporting the shift from “doing-jobs” to activities that add value for analogue employees.

 

Digital assistants are a good solution for businesses that want to increase accessibility and quality, as well as improve response times in relation to their customers or employees.

A digital workforce will be able to take over and automate a large part of today’s manual business processes. A high proportion of processes associated with e.g. finance, reporting, customer service and HR is currently handled by employees who have to compensate for incomplete IT systems. This means that a lot of valuable time that could have been devoted to solving more complicated problems is spent carrying out work tasks that could be performed by digital assistants. Are you ready to hire your first digital assistant?

 

Almost 90% of all customer dialogues will be conducted via chat by 2020.

45% of all work tasks can be automated.

For consumers, digital assistants like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana are able to answer many general questions and offer recommendations based on a user’s profile, past behavior, and other information. Get the directions you need while avoiding congested traffic, pick up that coffee you ordered, and check in to your hotel—all with the help of your digital assistant. If you are going to be out of town for a few days, your digital assistant can tell you the weather forecast at home and turn down the heat while you are away.

For businesses, digital assistants provide a single, convenient point of contact for contractors and customers. Digital assistants are most commonly used in customer contact centers to manage incoming communications. They’re also used for internal purposes, such as to onboard new employees.

For IT operations, chatbots are frequently used to enhance the service management experience by automating employee services and making them accessible to more people. With an intelligent chatbot, common tasks, such as resetting passwords, system status updates, outage alerts, ordering supplies, and knowledge management can be easily automated and made available around the clock.

The services provided vary depending on the types and quality of the digital assistant’s natural language capabilities, AI, and other technologies used—the more advanced the digital assistant, the more business functions it can perform. For example, the latest digital assistants can:

Automate responses for the most common IT service desk questions including informational and transactional requests.
Remind an employee to submit an expense report and help them do so.
Answer complex questions such as, “Where is the coffee shop closest to the convention center that is open until 8 p.m. and that has parking available?”
Connect with multiple back-end business systems (such as sales, marketing, and customer relations) to make targeted suggestions to customers and workers.
Transfer users as needed to expert staff. Some digital assistants can seamlessly manage transitions between chatbots, live agents, and back again.

					<h3> Govt support necessary to increase penetration of robotic surgery in tier 2, 3 cities</h3>
						<img src="resources/robot.jpeg" alt="robots in surgeries" title="robot" class="img"/>
						<p>
				Apart from the pandemic due to which the project was delayed by almost an year, the biggest hurdle that slowed us down is the dependency on foreign manufactures for importing sophisticated equipment.
				Despite decades of successful robotic-assisted surgeries globally that have positively impacted millions of patients, the access is scarce at large. The dominant current robotic system is expensive and associated with a steep learning curve, resulting in the limited availability across the world of over six billion people. In an exclusive conversation with Financial Express Online Dr. Sudhir P. Srivastava, Founder, Chairman & CEO, SS Innovations said that robotics shall be the future of surgery, and he aims to create a technologically advanced system that will be cost-effective, easy to use, and can be applied to all surgical specialties. Thus, benefitting most patients around the world. Compared to conventional surgery, robotic surgery results in smaller incisions, that reduces pain, scarring and leads to quicker recovery, he added. Excerpts:
				Over the last 70 years, medicine has advanced significantly because of new discoveries, developments and newer technologies from a plain X-Ray to CT Scans, MRIs, ECHOs and 3D imaging to give more details about the disease process.  Various Artificial Intelligence and algorithms can determine very quickly in relation to differential diagnoses.  There are machines that can give quick interpretations in remote areas where there are no doctors present, for example to generate an EKG report with interpretation utilizing AI and machine learning.  The utilization of technology in the field of medicine has always been important with the goal of advancing science.  A perfect example of this is the comparison between minimally invasive surgery and traditional open surgical techniques.  The traditional techniques carried with them an increased risk of infection, slower recovery times and post-operative pain which ultimately affected the quality of life of the patient.

There was an evolution of surgery from these open techniques to laparoscopic, or keyhole, surgery and today robotic assisted surgery.  Additionally, various treatment methodologies have changed, instead of excision, now ablation of cancers within the body is done to prevent systemic side effects of various treatments.  Nanotechnology is now being used in relation to drug delivery in targeted therapy for various systemic diseases.  Stem cell research is ongoing with regards to the regeneration of organs and 3D printing is now being used for modelling of organs to better understand the disease processes.  Lastly, telemedicine has come to the forefront with astonishing advancements where medical diagnosis and care can be done remotely and telesurgery, where surgery can be done remotely utilizing technological advancements in connection speeds and bandwidth
